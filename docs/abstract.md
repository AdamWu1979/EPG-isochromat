* `SPGR_runme_1.m`: Compares transient SPGR simulations
* `FSE_runme.m`: Compares transient FSE simulations
* `SPGR_runme_2.m`: Compares steady-state SPGR simulations with and without inclusion of diffusion

####Â Compatibility
All work was carried out using Matlab R2015a. Some display and annotation functions may not work in older releases
